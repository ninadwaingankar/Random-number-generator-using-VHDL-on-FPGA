# Random-number-generator-using-VHDL-on-FPGA

VHDL implementation of random number generator from 0 to 15 (4 bits). 
The random number is displayed on LED vector display on FPGA. 
Implemented on Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA..vhd is VHDL file.ucf is user implementation file. 
assign IO pins on FPGA with pins in the.ucf file.
Random number generation is done by continuous XOR operation of bit vector at clock pulses.
